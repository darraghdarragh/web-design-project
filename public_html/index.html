  <h2>Mission &amp; Philosophy – Absolute Healing</h2>

  <div class="readmore-wrap">
    <p>
      At Absolute Healing, our mission is to support meaningful, lasting healing by addressing the whole person - body, mind, emotions, and energy.
      We believe that every individual carries an innate ability to heal, and that true wellness emerges when underlying imbalances, emotional patterns,
      and belief systems are gently identified and released.
    </p>

    <div class="more">
      <p class="mt-3">
        Our philosophy is rooted in compassion, respect, and individualized care. Each client is met where they are, without judgment, and supported through a personalized healing journey that honours their unique experiences, needs, and goals.
        We recognise that symptoms are often signals of deeper imbalance, and we work holistically to uncover and address root causes rather than focusing solely on surface-level concerns.
      </p>

      <p class="mt-3">
        By integrating energy healing, traditional and complementary therapies, and intuitive insight, Absolute Healing creates a safe and supportive space for transformation, balance, and self-awareness.
        Our goal is not only to relieve discomfort, but to help clients reconnect with their inner strength, emotional clarity, and resilience - empowering them to move forward with greater clarity, vitality, and emotional freedom.
      </p>

      <p class="mt-3">
        Healing is not a one-size-fits-all process; it is a partnership. At Absolute Healing, we are committed to walking alongside each client with integrity, professionalism, and care, supporting their path toward wholeness and wellbeing.

      <h2>Carol Kenny</h2>
      <p class="mb-1"><strong>Founder &amp; Lead Practitioner – Absolute Healing</strong></p>

      <div class="readmore-wrap">
        <p>
          Carol Kenny is the founder and lead practitioner of Absolute Healing, a holistic wellness practice dedicated to supporting deep physical, emotional, and energetic healing.
          With over 25 years of professional experience, Carol brings a highly integrated, intuitive, and client-centred approach to health and wellbeing.
        </p>

        <p>
          Throughout her career, Carol has trained extensively across a wide range of healing modalities, allowing her to address not only physical symptoms, but also the emotional, energetic, and belief-based patterns that influence overall health.
          Her work is grounded in the understanding that true healing occurs when the body, mind, and spirit are treated as a whole.
        </p>

        <div class="more">
          <p>
            Carol’s practice combines advanced energy healing systems with traditional and complementary therapies, with Kinesiology serving as a key assessment and facilitation tool within her work.
            She is certified in Emotion Code, Body Code, and Belief Code, enabling her to identify and release trapped emotions, energetic imbalances, and subconscious belief systems that may be contributing to pain, illness, or emotional distress.
          </p>

          <p>
            In addition to energy-based techniques, Carol is trained in Acupuncture and Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), bringing a strong foundation in Eastern healing principles, meridian theory, and the body’s natural capacity to restore balance.
            Her background also includes Reflexology and Reproreflexology, supporting systemic health, hormonal balance, fertility, and reproductive wellbeing.
          </p>

          <p>
            Carol is a Reiki Master and Rahanni Teacher, working with high-frequency energies that promote relaxation, emotional clarity, spiritual growth, and gentle yet profound healing.
            She further enhances her sessions through the use of Australian Bush Flower Remedies, crystals, and Aura-Soma, supporting emotional harmony, energetic alignment, and self-awareness.
          </p>

          <p>
            Known for her compassionate presence, intuitive insight, and depth of experience, Carol creates a safe and supportive environment where clients feel heard, respected, and empowered.
            Her clients often seek support for emotional release, anxiety, stress, trauma, chronic issues, life transitions, and personal growth.
          </p>

          <p>
            Through Absolute Healing, Carol remains committed to helping clients reconnect with their innate healing ability, restore balance, and move forward with greater clarity, vitality, and wellbeing.
