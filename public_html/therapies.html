            <p>Treatments are guided by an individualised assessment that considers physical symptoms, emotional wellbeing, lifestyle factors, and energetic patterns.</p>

          <h2>Emotion Code, Body Code &amp; Belief Code</h2>
          <p class="lead">Carol at Absolute Healing is certified in the Emotion Code, Body Code, and Belief Code — powerful energy-based systems designed to identify and release emotional, energetic, and subconscious imbalances that may be affecting physical health, emotional wellbeing, and overall quality of life.</p>
          <div class="more">
            <h3>Emotion Code</h3>
            <p>The Emotion Code focuses on identifying and releasing trapped emotions stored in the body, which may contribute to pain, emotional distress, anxiety, or recurring patterns. It uses muscle testing to communicate with the subconscious mind and identify what the body is ready to release. This bypasses conscious thinking and resistance.</p>
            <h3>Body Code</h3>
            <p>The Body Code expands upon the Emotion Code by addressing a broad range of underlying imbalances such as energetic systems, organs and glands, toxins, pathogens, nutritional deficiencies, structural misalignments, and stressors. It helps restore balance across multiple systems and supports the body returning to its natural state of healing and alignment.</p>
            <h3>Belief Code</h3>
            <p>The Belief Code focuses on identifying and clearing limiting or false subconscious beliefs that can influence thoughts, behaviours, emotional responses, and physical health. By releasing these belief systems, a person can create space for clarity, empowerment, and positive change.</p>
            <p>Carol at Absolute Healing offers a combination of the Emotion Code, Body Code, and Belief Code tailored to each client’s needs, supporting healing to occur at a pace that feels safe and supportive.</p>
            <p>Clients, including animals, often seek these therapies for emotional release, anxiety, stress, trauma support, chronic issues, personal growth, and life transitions.</p>
            <p>Together, the Emotion Code, Body Code, and Belief Code offer a deeply holistic approach to restoring balance, clarity, and overall wellbeing.</p>

          <h2>Crystal Therapy</h2>
          <p class="lead">Crystal Therapy is a gentle, non-invasive energy therapy that uses the vibrational properties of crystals to support balance and wellbeing.</p>
          <div class="more">
            <p>Crystals may be placed on or around the body (or within the energy field) to help clear energetic blockages, support chakra alignment, and encourage a calm, grounded state.</p>
            <p>Crystal Therapy is often combined with Reiki and Seichem for enhanced energetic support.</p>
            <p>It can be helpful for stress, emotional overwhelm, fatigue, anxiety, grief, and periods of transition.</p>
            <p>Many clients report a deep sense of relaxation and clarity after a session.</p>
